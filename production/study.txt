IDEA ONE:
Language: English 

My frist encounter with "English" 

- My parents sent me to an English-based kindergarten.
- In my primary school, I met a very bad English teacher, and she made me lose interest in English.

- When I was thrown into an international school in Taiwan, on the first day of class, I was super confused because I really could not understand anything the teacher was talking about. This is when I thought to myself, "I really need to learn English now."

- For a semester or two, I remember myself struggling with class time and homework in English. But as time goes on, I realize that I can slowly understand the teacher more and more, and it takes me less effort to do homework.



IDEA TWO:
Simbol: Octopus 

My name in chinese sounds like Octopus head. 

- I have changed my name once, and my first name is similar to "Octopus."
- When I was in elementary school in a cram school, I remember my teacher once joked about my name sounding similar to "Octopus." I recall being so mad that I literally stood up and left the room. I sat outside the room until the teacher told me to go back.
- In middle school, my parents decided to change my Chinese name, which, with "destiny," still sounded like "octopus head" again
- with my unavoidable association with the word "octopus" in my name, I decided that I'm going to embrace it and make it a part of me.
