IDEA ONE:
Language: English 

My frist encounter with "English" 

- My parents sent me to an English-based kindergarten.
- In my primary school, I met a very bad English teacher, and she made me lose interest in English.
- When I was thrown into an international school in Taiwan, on the first day of class, I was super confused because I really could not understand anything the teacher was talking about. This is when I thought to myself, "I really need to learn English now."
- For a semester or two, I remember myself struggling with class time and homework in English. But as time goes on, I realize that I can slowly understand the teacher more and more, and it takes me less effort to do homework.

IDEA TWO:
Symbol: Octopus 

My name in chinese sounds like Octopus head. 

- I have changed my name once, and my first name is similar to "Octopus."
- When I was in elementary school in a cram school, I remember my teacher once joked about my name sounding similar to "Octopus." I recall being so mad that I literally stood up and left the room. I sat outside the room until the teacher told me to go back.
- In middle school, my parents decided to change my Chinese name, which, with "destiny," still sounded like "octopus head" again
- After I changed my name, I didn't initially realize the connection between my name and an octopus head. However, once my friends found out about my new name and wouldn't stop joking about it, I realized that my name once again sounded similar to "octopus."
- with my unavoidable association with the word "octopus" in my name, I decided that I'm going to embrace it and make it a part of me, since it is literially part of me by being my chinese name.

Dumbo Octopus
- Grimpoteuthis is a genus of pelagic cirrate (finned) octopods known as the dumbo octopuses.

- The name 'dumbo' originates from their resemblance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film Dumbo, having two prominent ear-like fins which extend from the mantle above each eye.
- The dumbo octopus (Grimpoteuthis ) is a deep sea animal that lives on the ocean floor at extreme depths of 9,800 to 13,000 feet.
- They are small animals, around 8 inches tall, and have a pair of fins located on their mantle—their namesake—and webbing between their arms


Mimic Octopus
- The mimic octopus (Thaumoctopus mimicus) is a species of octopus from the Indo-Pacific region. Like other octopuses, it uses its chromatophores to disguise itself with its background.

- The mimic octopus is a smaller octopus, growing to a total length of about 60 cm (2 ft), including arms, with a diameter approximately that of a pencil at their widest.
- Small horns protrude from each eye. The octopus' natural color is light brown/beige, but it usually takes on a more noticeable hue of striped white and brown to scare off predators by imitating poisonous species and vicious, territorial sea creatures. Its ability to change shape is the reason it was named the 'mimic' octopus, which is its main defense besides camouflage.
- The mimic octopus was first discovered off the coast of Sulawesi, Indonesia in 1998 on the bottom of a muddy river mouth.
- The mimic octopus uses a jet of water through its funnel to glide over the sand while searching for prey, typically small fish, crabs, and worms.


Blanket octopus
- Tremoctopus is a genus of pelagic cephalopods, containing four species that occupy surface to mid-waters in subtropical and tropical oceans.

- They are commonly known as blanket octopuses, in reference to the long, transparent webs that connect the dorsal and dorsolateral arms of the adult females. The other arms are much shorter and lack webbing.
- Females may reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in length, whereas the males are 2.4 cm (1 inch). The weight ratio is at least 10,000:1, and can probably reach as much as 40,000:1. The males have a large arm in a spherical pouch modified for mating, known as a hectocotylus.
- The common blanket octopus (Tremoctopus violaceus) exhibits one of the most extreme sexual size-dimorphism known in any animal near its size or larger.


Giant Pacific octopus
- The giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini), also known as the North Pacific giant octopus, is a large marine cephalopod belonging to the genus Enteroctopus.

- Its spatial distribution includes the coastal North Pacific, along Mexico (Baja California), The United States (California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska), Canada (British Columbia), Russia, Eastern China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.
- It can be found from the intertidal zone down to 2,000 m (6,600 ft), and is best adapted to cold, oxygen-rich water.
- It is arguably the largest octopus species.
